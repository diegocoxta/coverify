## :thinking: Motivation

Since the iTunes era I like to customize my music collection with pretty covers and in Spotify, I like to follow the pattern they adopt in their official playlists.

So, I migrated my [Figma templates](https://www.figma.com/file/YQ2fg9I1X6MAhhhZysFEgl/Spotify-Playlist-Covers?node-id=0%3A1) to this webapp to make my life easier.
